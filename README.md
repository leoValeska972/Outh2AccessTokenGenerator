# OAuth2 Access Token Generator

This guide provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to obtain an OAuth2 Access Token from the Google Cloud Console using a Client ID. Access Tokens are crucial for authenticating and authorizing applications to interact with various Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. Follow these steps to generate an Access Token for your project using a Client ID.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Google Cloud Console Account**: You must have a Google Cloud Console account. If you don't have one, you can easily [create a new account](https://cloud.google.com/).

2. **Google Cloud Project**: Create a new project or select an existing one in the Google Cloud Console.

3. **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**: Create a Client ID for your application in the Google Cloud Console under the "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" section. When creating the Client ID, it's essential to choose the appropriate OAuth scopes that match your application's permissions. These scopes define what your application can access, so select them carefully.

   **Note**: The choice of scopes may vary depending on your project's requirements, and the linked video tutorial may not cover this aspect in detail.

# Jar Files

You'll need to add these two JAR files to your build path:

- [http.jar](http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/h/Downloadhttp221jar.htm)
- [json.jar](https://jar-download.com/artifacts/org.json)

## Obtaining the OAuth2 Access Token

Now that you've set up your Google Cloud Project, created a Client ID, and learned how to generate the Client ID and Client Secret through the video guide, you can proceed to obtain the OAuth2 Access Token.

Follow these steps:

1. **Configure Your Application**: Add the Client ID, Client Secret, Redirect URI, and Scopes generated earlier in the `Config.java` file. Make sure to specify the Redirect URI used during the Client ID creation and define the required OAuth2 scopes that align with your application's permissions.

2. **Run the Project**: Execute this project. This will initiate the OAuth2 flow and, if configured correctly, prompt you to log in with your Google account and grant the requested permissions.

3. **Obtain the Access Token**: Upon successful authentication and authorization, your application will receive an Access Token. This Access Token is your key to securely access various Google Cloud services on behalf of your application.

By following these steps, you'll successfully obtain an OAuth2 Access Token, and your application will be ready to interact securely with Google Cloud services.
